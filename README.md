# Video-Ball-PCB

http://www.pong-story.com/eaus0576.htm This is were I got the information about bulding this.

All I have done is take the PCB layout from the magazine and import it in to Kicad (Took a long time as all the holes had to be added manually).
I have also made the silk screen for the PCB as the original one from the magazine could not be converterd very well to a black and white.
Some of the schematic has been also recreated.

No jumpers are required but are still on the silk screen.
