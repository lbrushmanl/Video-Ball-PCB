# Video-Ball-PCB

http://www.pong-story.com/eaus0576.htm This is where I got the information about building this.

All I have done is take the PCB layout from the magazine and import it into Kicad (It took a long time as all the holes had to be added manually).
I have also made the silk screen for the PCB as the original one from the magazine could not be converted very well to black and white.
Some of the schematics has also been recreated.

No jumpers are required, but they are still on the silk screen.
